## Objective:
Analyzing wine reviews dataset to uncover insights about wine quality, regional preferences, and pricing trends. Understand what characteristics define a wine as high-quality and tasty.

## Project Scope
We use Wine Reviews Data 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews
From there for our analysis we take Country, Description, Points, Price, and Variety as main variables of interest.
In most plots we consider best wines to have mean points >= 95.
The worst wines presented in this dataset have mean points >= 80 and <=85.
For more detailed analysis of wine production in specific countries we take Europe as object of study, but for main plots we consider the whole world.

## Goals
- Identifying popular wine varieties and their characteristics.
- Analyzing the relationship between wine quality ratings and prices.
- Examining wine quality for each country and defining locations of best wines.
- Understanding how wine description differes depending on good or (relatively) bad wines are observed.

## Approach
> Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and patterns in the data.
> Statistical analysis to uncover relationships and correlations between price and points.
> Data visualization techniques (plots, mapping, wordcloud).

## Expected Outcome
> Insights into wine preferences and market peculiarities for wine producers and distributors.
> Recommendations for consumers based on wine price, quality, taste, and country characteristics.
> Contribution to the broader wine community by sharing knowledge and insights gained from the analysis.
