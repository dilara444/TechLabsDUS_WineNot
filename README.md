# Objective:
Analyzing wine reviews dataset to uncover insights about wine quality, regional preferences, and pricing trends. Understand what characteristics define a wine as high-quality and tasty.

# Project Scope
We use Wine Reviews Data 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews
From there for our analysis we take Country, Description, Points, Price, and Variety as main variables of interest
In most plots we consider best wines to have mean points >= 95
The worst wines presented in this dataset have mean points >= 80 and <=85
For more detailed analysis of wine production in specific countries we take Europe as object of study, but for main plots we consider the whole world
