## Objective:
Analyzing wine reviews dataset to uncover insights about wine quality, regional preferences, and pricing trends. Understand what characteristics define a wine as high-quality and tasty. Visualization of various factors that distinguish corresponding wine varieties. 

## Project Scope
We use Wine Reviews Data 
> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zynicide/wine-reviews

The scope of this project was to get an inside about some characteristics of different wine types all over the world. 
From there for our analysis we took Country, Description, Points, Price, and Variety as main variables of interest. This dataset showed interests of different insides to wine types from different countries. Besides the very obvious connection between wine origin and respective rating of this, other characteristics such as taste desription and price did contribute to a deeper understanding of both economical and physiological composition of wines. 

## Goals
- Identifying popular wine varieties and their characteristics.
- Analyzing the relationship between wine quality ratings and prices.
- Examining wine quality for each country and defining locations of best wines.
- Understanding how wine description differes depending on good or (relatively) bad wines are observed.

## Approach
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure and patterns in the data.
- Statistical analysis to uncover relationships and correlations between price and points.
- Data visualization techniques (plots, mapping, wordcloud).
- In most plots we consider best wines to have points >= 95.
- The worst wines presented in this dataset have points >= 80 and <=85.
- For more detailed analysis of wine production in specific countries we take Europe as object of study, but for main plots we consider the whole world.

## Used Libraries
- Pandas
- Geopandas
- Matplotlib
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- SciPy
- Wordcloud

## Expected Outcome
- Insights into wine preferences and market peculiarities for wine producers and distributors.
- Recommendations for consumers based on wine price, quality, taste, and country characteristics.
- Contribution to the broader wine community by sharing knowledge and insights gained from the analysis.
